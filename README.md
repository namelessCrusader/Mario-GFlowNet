# Mario-GFlowNet
For this project we focus on generating Super Mario Bros levels. A lot of work has been done with Mario levels using supervised learning, but most of them require a lot of training data, which there is not much available of with the original levels. Hence we begin a line of work using GFlowNets to generate Mario Levels.
