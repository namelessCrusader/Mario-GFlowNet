# Mario-GFlowNet
For this project we focus on generating Super Mario Bros levels. A lot of work has been done with Mario levels using supervised learning, but most of them require a lot of training data, which there is not much available of with the original levels. Hence we begin a line of work using GFlowNets to generate Mario Levels.

The levels can be generated by running:

1. ```python FlowMatching.py``` to train a model using the flow matching objective of GFlowNets
2. ```python TrajectoryBalance.py``` to train a model using the trajectory balance objective of GFlowNets
